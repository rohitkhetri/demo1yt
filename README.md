For running an app, you can 
Download the zip file.
Extract the file in flutter folder.
(I have used VSCode)
You can connect to the emulator or connect to the device 
Run the application
Register or Login using your name.
After login, the Dashboard screen will open.

I have implemented the validation of login and register using sqlite database.
In dashboard, Menu Drawer is visible and also bottom navigations screens is visible for demo.
When we click Featured products or Recently viewed products another screen called Allproducts(Demo) will open.
